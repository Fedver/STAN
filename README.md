The web is full of high quality data in the form of tables that could be integrated to generate new knowledge. However web tables are often lacking in semantics. A crucial problem is the correct relationships detection between a table and an ontology in order to define the semantics. The contributions of this work in this context are mainly three. Development of a tool for semi-automatic annotation of tables that lets non technicians carry out the annotation process. The definition of the possible types of model for table annotation. The use and the testing of the tool in a real eCommerce case study. In particular the focus in testing is the quality of annotation suggestions compared to other existing annotation tools.
